Business Proposal 1: The Public Marketplace

Company: PartPal
Slogan: Know every part.
Project Title: PartPal Marketplace

Date: 4 October 2025

Prepared For: Potential Investors & Strategic Partners

1. Executive Summary

PartPal is a technology company founded on a simple mission: to organize the used auto parts industry so that you can "Know every part."

This proposal details our public-facing platform, the PartPal Marketplace. This platform will serve as South Africa's premier online destination for used auto parts. It is not an e-commerce store but a specialized classifieds and directory service that connects individual buyers (mechanics, hobbyists) with a vast network of sellers (scrap yards, auto dismantlers).

The South African used auto parts market is highly fragmented. The PartPal Marketplace solves this by providing a single, centralized, and user-friendly search engine. By empowering users to find exactly what they need, we bring our slogan to life. Monetization will be achieved through featured listings and on-site advertising, creating an asset-light, highly scalable business model under the trusted PartPal brand.

2. The Problem

    For Buyers: Finding a specific used part requires phoning or visiting multiple scrap yards—a time-consuming and often fruitless process. There is no central database to check inventory across different sellers.

    For Sellers: Most scrap yards have a limited local customer base and lack the technical ability to effectively market their vast, changing inventory online, thus missing out on significant sales opportunities.

3. The Solution: PartPal Marketplace

The PartPal Marketplace aggregates used auto parts from sellers across South Africa into a single, searchable platform. Our core value proposition is connection and discovery.

    We provide sellers with the visibility to reach thousands of potential buyers.

    We provide buyers with a powerful tool to quickly locate the exact parts they need, saving them time and money.

The transaction is handled directly between the buyer and seller, minimizing our operational complexity.

4. Functionality of the Website (The Buyer's Experience)

The marketplace website will be designed for simplicity, speed, and trust.

    Homepage: A clean interface dominated by a powerful search bar, branded with the PartPal logo and the slogan "Know every part." Users can search by:

        Vehicle: Year, Make, and Model.

        Part Name: Keyword search (e.g., "alternator").

        Part Number: For professional mechanics.

    Search Results Page: Results are displayed in a clear format. Filters will be available to narrow results by:

        Location: Province (e.g., Gauteng, Western Cape) and City.

        Seller Type: Commercial Scrap Yard or Private Seller.

    Part Listing Page: A detailed page for each part, including high-quality photos, a detailed description, and information about the seller. A prominent "Contact Seller" button facilitates the connection.

    Seller Profile Page: Each seller, verified by PartPal, has a public profile with their business details, contact information, and a full gallery of their parts listed on the marketplace.

5. Marketing & Sales Strategy

Our growth depends on building both sides of the marketplace.

    Seller Acquisition: We will directly approach scrap yards and offer them the use of our powerful backend software, the PartPal IMS, which allows them to easily list their inventory on the marketplace.

    Buyer Acquisition: Aggressive digital marketing campaigns targeting South African car enthusiasts and mechanics, positioning PartPal as the go-to destination to find any part.

6. Monetization Strategy

We will generate revenue without interfering in the transaction.

    Featured Listings: Sellers can pay a fee (e.g., R50) to have their listing appear at the top of relevant search results.

    On-Site Advertising: We will sell targeted banner ad space to complementary businesses, such as tool suppliers and courier services.

Business Proposal 2: The Inventory Management System (IMS)


Company: PartPal
Slogan: Know every part.
Project Title: PartPal IMS (Inventory Management System)

Date: 4 October 2025

Prepared For: Potential B2B Customers & Investors

1. Executive Summary

PartPal is a technology company built to organize the used auto parts industry. This proposal details our professional B2B software solution, the PartPal IMS.

PartPal IMS is a cloud-based Inventory Management System (SaaS) designed to help scrap yard owners "Know every part." It digitizes their entire workflow, from vehicle acquisition to final sale, replacing outdated paper and spreadsheet systems. The system's most powerful feature is its seamless, one-click integration with the PartPal Marketplace, providing an instant online sales channel for our clients.
Our business model is based on tiered monthly subscriptions, creating a stable, recurring revenue stream while providing immense value to an underserved market.
2. The Problem

Scrap yard owners face significant operational hurdles:

    Inaccurate Inventory: They lack a real-time view of their stock, leading to lost time and "ghost inventory" that has already been sold.

    Inefficient Processes: Manual inventory logging is slow, labour-intensive, and prone to error.

    No Business Data: Owners have no easy way to track sales data or identify valuable trends.

    Barrier to E-commerce: Getting thousands of unique parts listed online is a daunting technical challenge.

3. The Solution: PartPal IMS

PartPal IMS is an intuitive and powerful software tool that makes a scrap yard owner's job easier. It is the engine that helps them truly "Know every part" in their yard—where it is, what condition it's in, and how much it's worth.

By managing their business through our IMS, sellers can, with a single click, publish their parts to the high-traffic PartPal Marketplace, instantly expanding their customer base from local to national.

4. Functionality of the Software (The Seller's Experience)

PartPal IMS is a secure, private dashboard for managing the business.

    Main Dashboard: An at-a-glance overview of the business: new vehicles, recent sales, and top-performing parts.

    Vehicle Check-In: A streamlined workflow to add a new vehicle by entering its VIN, which auto-populates its details.

    Digital Dismantling Module: An employee can use a tablet or smartphone in the yard to go through a checklist of high-value parts for a vehicle, quickly adding photos, condition notes, pricing, and a physical location (e.g., Aisle C, Shelf 4) for each part.

    Inventory Management: A powerful, searchable database of every part in stock. Sellers can edit details and mark items as "Available," "Reserved," or "Sold."

    One-Click Publishing: Next to each part in the inventory is a toggle switch labeled "List on PartPal Marketplace." When switched on, the part is instantly pushed live to the public marketplace. When a part is marked "Sold," it is automatically removed from the marketplace.

    Sales & Reporting: Log sales from all channels and generate simple reports on revenue and best-sellers.

5. Marketing & Sales Strategy

Our approach is B2B-focused and built on a foundation of value.

    Freemium Model: Our "Starter Plan" (free for up to 20 parts) is our most powerful marketing tool, allowing any seller to experience the benefits of PartPal IMS with zero risk.

    Direct Outreach: A dedicated sales team will conduct on-site demos for medium to large scrap yards, showcasing how our system can increase their efficiency and profitability.

6. Monetization Strategy

We will use a tiered monthly subscription model to generate predictable, recurring revenue.

    Starter Plan: R0/month. Manage up to 20 parts.

    Professional Plan: R499/month. Manage up to 5,000 parts, allows for bulk CSV uploads, and includes 5 user accounts.

    Enterprise Plan: Custom Pricing. For large, multi-location operations, offering unlimited parts, API access, and a dedicated account manager.
