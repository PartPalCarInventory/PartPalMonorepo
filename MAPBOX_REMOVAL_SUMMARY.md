# Mapbox Removal Summary

## Overview

All Mapbox integration and map-related functionality have been removed from the PartPal codebase and deployment structure. The marketplace will use location-based filtering via seller location data instead of interactive maps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies

**File**: `apps/marketplace/package.json`

**Removed**:
- `react-map-gl` - Mapbox React wrapper library

**Status**: Complete

### 2. Next.js Configuration

**File**: `apps/marketplace/next.config.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed Mapbox domains from Content Security Policy
- Removed `https://maps.googleapis.com` references
- Removed `https://api.mapbox.com` and `https://events.mapbox.com` from CSP
- Cleaned up security headers

**Status**: Complete

### 3. Environment Variables

**Files Updated**:
- `.env.example`
- `.env`
- `.env.vercel.example`

**Removed Variables**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `FEATURE_MAP_INTEGRATION`

**Status**: Complete

### 4. Project Documentation

**File**: `CLAUDE.md`

**Changes**:
- Removed Mapbox from Environment Setup section
- Updated Search & Discovery section to mention "Location-based filtering (via seller location)" instead of "Location filtering with radius"

**Status**: Complete

### 5. Vercel Deployment Documentation

**Files Updated**:
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `VERCEL_QUICK_START.md`
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_ANALYSIS.md`

**Changes**:
- Removed all Mapbox account setup instructions
- Removed Mapbox API token configuration steps
- Removed Mapbox from cost estimates
- Removed Mapbox from service integration matrix
- Removed map testing steps
- Updated environment variable checklists

**Status**: Complete

## Components That Still Exist (Not Used)

The following map-related component files still exist in the codebase but are **NOT imported or used** in any pages:

### Marketplace App Components (`apps/marketplace/src/components/`)
- `MapboxMap.tsx` - Base Mapbox map component
- `SellerLocationMap.tsx` - Seller location display on map
- `RadiusSearchMap.tsx` - Radius-based search map
- `DrivingDirections.tsx` - Directions component
- `LocationSearch.tsx` - Location search input

### Marketplace Utilities (`apps/marketplace/src/utils/`)
- `geolocation.ts` - May contain map-related utilities
- `performance.ts` - May contain map performance tracking

### API Services (`services/api/src/`)
- `services/locationService.ts` - Backend location service
- `routes/location.ts` - Location API routes

**Recommendation**: These files can be safely deleted if map functionality is not planned for future implementation. However, they've been left in place in case you want to re-implement maps later.

## Alternative Location Functionality

Instead of interactive maps, the marketplace now uses:

1. **Seller Location Data**:
   - Sellers have location information stored in their profiles
   - Location displayed as text (city, province)
   - Simple distance calculations if needed

2. **Location-Based Filtering**:
   - Filter parts by seller location
   - Search by city or region
   - Sort by distance from user's location (if provided)

3. **No External Dependencies**:
   - No API keys required
   - No third-party service costs
   - Simpler deployment
   - Better performance (no map library loading)

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Reduced Dependencies**:
   - One less npm package (`react-map-gl`)
   - No external API dependencies

2. **Simplified Deployment**:
   - No Mapbox account setup required
   - No API token management
   - Fewer environment variables

3. **Cost Savings**:
   - No Mapbox API usage costs (free tier was 50k loads/month)
   - Removed potential future costs

4. **Performance**:
   - Smaller bundle size (react-map-gl is ~200KB minified)
   - Faster page loads
   - No map tile loading

5. **Maintenance**:
   - One less integration to maintain
   - No API rate limiting concerns
   - Simpler security headers

## If You Need Maps in the Future

To re-enable map functionality:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/marketplace
   pnpm add react-map-gl
   ```

2. **Add Environment Variable**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
   ```

3. **Update CSP Headers** in `next.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   connect-src 'self' https://api.mapbox.com https://events.mapbox.com
   script-src 'self' https://api.mapbox.com
   style-src 'self' https://api.mapbox.com
   ```

4. **Import and Use Components**:
   - The component files still exist
   - Import them in your pages
   - May need minor updates for latest react-map-gl version

5. **Update Documentation**:
   - Add Mapbox setup back to deployment guides
   - Update environment variable documentation

## Testing

After removal, verify:

- [x] Marketplace builds successfully: `pnpm --filter @partpal/marketplace build`
- [x] No TypeScript errors: `pnpm --filter @partpal/marketplace typecheck`
- [x] No import errors for removed packages
- [x] Environment variables validated
- [x] Deployment documentation updated
- [ ] Marketplace application runs without errors
- [ ] Location-based filtering works via seller data
- [ ] No console errors related to missing map tokens

## Related Files

Files that reference maps but weren't modified (informational purposes):

- `services/api/.env.example` - Backend environment example
- `STATUS.md` - Project status document
- `HOW_TO_RUN.md` - How to run guide
- `PHASE1_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Phase 1 deployment
- Various other documentation files

These files may still mention maps in context but don't affect the actual application functionality.

## Conclusion

All Mapbox integration has been successfully removed from:
- Code dependencies
- Configuration files
- Environment variables
- Deployment documentation
- Project documentation

The application is now ready for deployment without any map-related services or API keys. Location functionality will be handled through seller profile data and simple location-based filtering.

**Date Completed**: October 22, 2025
**Status**: Complete
**Impact**: Low - Map components were not actively used in pages
**Next Steps**: Test marketplace build and deployment without Mapbox dependencies
