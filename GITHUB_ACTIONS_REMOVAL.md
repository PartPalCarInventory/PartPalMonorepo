# GitHub Actions Removal Summary

## Overview

All GitHub Actions workflows have been removed from the repository. The project now relies exclusively on Vercel for deployments, with all CI/CD workflows preserved locally for reference.

## Changes Made

### 1. Workflows Removed from Repository

**Total Files Removed**: 6 workflow files + 1 README

**Workflow Files**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI Pipeline (lint, type-check, build)
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Test Suite (unit tests, integration tests)
- `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` - Docker image building
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Production deployment automation
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` - Staging deployment automation
- `.github/workflows/aws-deploy-eks.yml` - AWS EKS deployment (already removed)
- `.github/workflows/aws-docker-build.yml` - AWS Docker builds (already removed)
- `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml` - Infrastructure as code (already removed)

pnpm install
  pnpm typecheck
  pnpm lint
  pnpm test
  pnpm build
**Documentation**:
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflows documentation

### 2. Files Preserved Locally

All workflows backed up to: `.local-deployment-configs/`

**Backup Contents** (10 workflow files):
```
.local-deployment-configs/
├── ci.yml                      # CI Pipeline
├── test.yml                    # Test Suite
├── docker-build.yml            # Docker builds
├── deploy-production.yml       # Production deployment
├── deploy-staging.yml          # Staging deployment
├── aws-deploy-eks.yml          # AWS EKS deployment
├── aws-docker-build.yml        # AWS Docker builds
├── infrastructure.yml          # Infrastructure automation
├── WORKFLOWS_README.md         # Original README
└── [other deployment files]
```

### 3. Updated .gitignore

Changed from:
```gitignore
.github/workflows/aws-*.yml
.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml
```

To:
```gitignore
.github/workflows/
```

Now the entire `.github/workflows/` directory is excluded from git tracking.

## Rationale

### Why Remove GitHub Actions?

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Vercel handles all deployments automatically
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to maintain separate CI/CD pipelines
3. **Cost Savings**: GitHub Actions minutes not required
4. **Faster Deployments**: Vercel's built-in CI/CD is optimized
5. **Automatic Previews**: Pull request previews without custom workflows

### What Vercel Provides

Vercel automatically handles:
- Building applications on every push
- Running preview deployments for pull requests
- Production deployments on main branch
- Environment variable management
- Build caching and optimization
- Deployment previews with unique URLs

## Commit Details

**Commit Hash**: 6ff22a8
**Commit Message**:
```
Remove GitHub Actions workflows and use Vercel deployments only

- Remove all GitHub Actions workflow files from repository
- Move workflows to .local-deployment-configs for local reference
- Update .gitignore to exclude .github/workflows directory
- Add deployment transition documentation
- Repository now configured for Vercel deployment only
```

**Files Changed**: 8 files
- Insertions: 321 lines
- Deletions: 1,721 lines
- Net reduction: 1,400 lines

## Workflow Functionality Comparison

### Previous GitHub Actions Setup

**CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`):
- Change detection
- Lint checks
- Type checking
- Unit tests
- Build verification
- Docker image builds
- Container registry pushes

**Test Suite** (`test.yml`):
- Lint and type checks
- Unit tests with PostgreSQL
- Integration tests
- API tests
- Coverage reports

**Deployment** (`deploy-*.yml`):
- Manual deployment triggers
- Environment-specific deploys
- Docker container deployment
- Health checks
- Rollback capabilities

### Current Vercel Setup

**Automatic on Every Push**:
- Build verification
- Type checking (via build)
- Deployment to preview/production
- Environment variable injection
- CDN distribution
- SSL certificate provisioning

**Manual Testing**:
- Run tests locally before push
- Use `pnpm test` command
- Use `pnpm typecheck` command
- Use `pnpm lint` command

## Testing Strategy

### Before (with GitHub Actions)
```
git push → GitHub Actions → Tests → Build → Deploy
```

### Now (with Vercel)
```
Local: pnpm test, typecheck, lint
git push → Vercel → Build → Deploy
```

**Recommended Workflow**:
```bash
# Before pushing
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build

# If all pass
git push
```

## Local Development Workflow

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Test specific workspace
pnpm --filter @partpal/ims test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Build verification
pnpm build
```

### Pre-commit Checks

You can use Husky hooks (already configured) to run checks before commits:

```bash
# The project has husky configured
# Pre-commit hooks will run automatically
git commit -m "Your message"
```

## Vercel Deployment Configuration

### Automatic Deployments

**Production Deployments**:
- Trigger: Push to `main` branch
- URL: Custom domain or `*.vercel.app`
- Environment: Production variables

**Preview Deployments**:
- Trigger: Push to any branch or pull request
- URL: Unique preview URL per deployment
- Environment: Preview variables

### Manual Testing in Vercel

1. **View Build Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Select project
   - View deployment logs

2. **Check Function Logs**:
   - Dashboard → Functions
   - View real-time logs
   - Debug issues

3. **Preview Deployments**:
   - Every PR gets automatic preview
   - Test before merging
   - Share preview URLs with team

## Benefits of This Change

### Simplification
1. No workflow YAML files to maintain
2. No GitHub Actions minutes to track
3. No separate CI/CD configuration
4. Single deployment platform (Vercel)

### Speed
1. Faster deployments (Vercel optimized)
2. No queue times
3. Instant preview URLs
4. Faster feedback loop

### Cost
1. No GitHub Actions cost (free tier limits)
2. Vercel includes CI/CD in platform
3. Simplified billing

### Developer Experience
1. Automatic preview deployments
2. Built-in deployment analytics
3. Easy rollback (one click)
4. Better deployment insights

## If You Need CI/CD Back

### Option 1: Restore GitHub Actions

```bash
# Copy workflows back
cp .local-deployment-configs/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Remove from gitignore
# Edit .gitignore to exclude .github/workflows/

# Add and commit
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Restore GitHub Actions workflows"
```

### Option 2: Use Vercel Checks

Vercel can run custom checks during builds:

```javascript
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build"
}
```

### Option 3: Pre-commit Hooks

Use Husky to run checks locally before commits:

```json
// .husky/pre-commit
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

## Local Backup Access

All workflows are preserved in `.local-deployment-configs/`:

```bash
# View workflow files
ls -la .local-deployment-configs/*.yml

# Read specific workflow
cat .local-deployment-configs/ci.yml

# View workflows README
cat .local-deployment-configs/WORKFLOWS_README.md
```

## Repository Status

### Current State
- Branch: main
- Ahead of origin: 2 commits
- GitHub Actions: Removed from repository
- Vercel: Ready for deployment
- CI/CD: Handled by Vercel

### Ready to Push

Push both commits to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

This will:
1. Remove AWS deployment configs from GitHub
2. Remove GitHub Actions workflows from GitHub
3. Add Vercel deployment documentation
4. Update .gitignore for future exclusions

## Testing Recommendations

Before pushing, verify:

1. **Build Works**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Types Check**:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   ```

3. **Linting Passes**:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

4. **Tests Pass**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

5. **Local Dev Works**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Vercel Setup Required

After pushing, set up Vercel:

1. **Create Vercel Account**: https://vercel.com
2. **Import Repository**: Connect GitHub repo
3. **Configure Projects**:
   - IMS app: `apps/ims`
   - Marketplace app: `apps/marketplace`
4. **Add Environment Variables**: Use `.env.vercel.example`
5. **Deploy**: Automatic on first import

See `VERCEL_QUICK_START.md` for detailed setup instructions.
