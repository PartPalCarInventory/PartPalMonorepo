## Agent Coordination Framework

### Start/Pause/Continue Mechanism

Each agent maintains a **task state file** (`agent-[name]-state.json`) with:
```json
{
  "currentTask": "authentication-system",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "completedTasks": ["user-management", "role-based-access"],
  "blockedOn": ["database-schema-completion"],
  "progress": 65,
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-04T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Coordination Rules

1. **Dependency Management**: Agents check dependencies before starting tasks
2. **Blocking Resolution**: Agents can request unblocking when dependencies complete
3. **Progress Tracking**: All agents report progress for project oversight
4. **Quality Gates**: Agents must pass quality checks before marking tasks complete
5. **Communication Protocol**: Agents update shared state for coordination

### Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] All agents complete their critical tasks
- [ ] Integration testing passes between all components
- [ ] Security audit completed and issues resolved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation complete for maintenance
- [ ] Deployment automation tested and verified
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

This agent breakdown ensures systematic, coordinated development with clear responsibilities, dependencies, and quality gates for production readiness.
