## Further Cost Optimization Options

### 1. AWS Savings Plans (All EKS Options)
**Commitment**: 1-3 year upfront payment
**Savings**: 30-40% on compute costs

| Configuration | Standard Monthly | With Savings Plan |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| EKS Minimal | $136 | ~$95 (~30% savings) |
| EKS 50-User | $181 | ~$130 (~28% savings) |
| EKS Full Scale | $300 | ~$210 (~30% savings) |

### 2. Reserved Instances (RDS)
**Commitment**: 1-3 year
**Savings**: 40-60% on database costs

Example for 50-User Configuration:
- Standard RDS Multi-AZ: $24/month
- Reserved Instance (1-yr): $14/month
- Savings: $10/month ($120/year)

### 3. Scheduled Scaling (EKS Options)
Scale down during off-hours (6pm-8am weekdays)

**Potential Savings**: $20-50/month depending on configuration

Example schedule:
```yaml
# Scale down to 1 replica at 6 PM
scale_down:
  cron: "0 18 * * 1-5"
  replicas: 1

# Scale up to 2 replicas at 8 AM
scale_up:
  cron: "0 8 * * 1-5"
  replicas: 2
```

### 4. Spot Instances (Development/Staging)
Use spot instances for non-production workloads

**Savings**: 60-80% on EC2 costs
**Risk**: Can be interrupted (not suitable for production)

## Migration Path: Growing with Your Business

### Phase 1: Startup (0-6 months)
**Users**: 3-4 per day
**Configuration**: AWS Lightsail
**Cost**: $26/month (~R468)

Start with minimal infrastructure to validate product-market fit.

**Users**: 10-20 daily, occasional peaks
**Configuration**: EKS Minimal
**Cost**: $136/month (~R2,448)
**Migration Time**: 4-6 hours

Upgrade when you consistently exceed 10 concurrent users or need auto-scaling.

### Phase 3: Business Established (18+ months)
**Users**: 50 concurrent
**Configuration**: EKS 50-User Optimized
**Cost**: $181/month (~R3,258)
**Migration Time**: 2-4 hours (from EKS Minimal)

Scale when you have steady user base and need high availability.

### Phase 4: Enterprise Scale (2+ years)
**Users**: 100+ concurrent
**Configuration**: EKS Full Scale
**Cost**: $300/month (~R5,400)
**Migration Time**: 4-6 hours (from 50-User)

Expand when demand requires higher performance and redundancy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I start with Lightsail and migrate to EKS later?
**A:** Yes, absolutely. The migration path is straightforward:
1. Export database from Lightsail PostgreSQL
2. Deploy EKS infrastructure with Terraform
3. Import database to RDS
4. Update DNS to point to new ALB
5. Downtime: 15-30 minutes

### Q: What happens if I exceed my user limits?
**A:**
- **Lightsail**: Performance degrades gradually, response times increase
- **EKS**: Auto-scaling kicks in (if configured), or you can manually scale
- **Recommendation**: Monitor CloudWatch metrics and scale proactively

### Q: How do I know when to upgrade?
**A:** Monitor these metrics:
- CPU usage consistently >70%
- Memory usage >80%
- Response times >1 second
- Error rate >2%
- Database connections >80% of limit

### Q: Can I mix configurations (e.g., Lightsail for staging, EKS for production)?
**A:** Yes, this is a cost-effective strategy:
- Staging: Lightsail ($26/month) or single-node EKS ($106/month)
- Production: EKS 50-User ($181/month)
- Total: $207-236/month vs $362/month for both on EKS

### Q: What about data transfer costs?
**A:** Included in estimates:
- **Lightsail**: 2TB included (more than sufficient)
- **EKS**: Data transfer estimated based on user load
- **Rule of thumb**: ~1GB per 1000 API requests

### Q: How do these costs compare to other cloud providers?
**A:**
- **Azure**: Similar pricing, slightly higher in Africa
- **Google Cloud**: 10-15% more expensive in Africa region
- **DigitalOcean**: Comparable to Lightsail, but limited Africa presence
- **AWS**: Best Africa (Cape Town) infrastructure and pricing
