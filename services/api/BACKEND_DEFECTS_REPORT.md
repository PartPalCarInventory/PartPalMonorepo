## Critical Defects

### 1. Database Configuration Mismatch
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma:10`
**Issue:** Prisma schema is configured for SQLite (`provider = "sqlite"`) while `.env.example:2` specifies PostgreSQL connection string.

**Impact:**
- Development environment will fail to connect to database
- Schema migrations will fail
- Production deployment will be blocked

**Evidence:**
```prisma
// schema.prisma line 10
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```
```env
# .env.example line 2
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://partpal:password@localhost:5432/partpal"
```

**Recommendation:** Update `schema.prisma` to use PostgreSQL or update environment configuration to use SQLite for development.

---

### 2. Missing Database Migration System
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `services/api/src/utils/database.ts:63-81`
**Issue:** The `runMigrations()` function only checks connection but doesn't actually run Prisma migrations. Comment indicates migrations should be run via CLI, but no startup script or deployment automation exists.

**Impact:**
- Database schema won't be synced on deployment
- New installations will have empty database without schema
- Version upgrades may have schema drift

**Evidence:**
```typescript
async runMigrations(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Note: In production, migrations should be run via Prisma CLI
    // This is mainly for development/testing environments
    console.log('Checking migration status...');
    // ... only checks connection, doesn't run migrations
```

**Recommendation:** Implement proper migration execution or add clear deployment documentation for running `prisma migrate deploy`.

---

### 3. Weak JWT Expiration Time
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `services/api/src/utils/auth.ts:22`, `.env.example:10`
**Issue:** Default JWT expiration is set to 7 days in `.env.example`, but code defaults to only 15 minutes if not specified. Inconsistent configuration creates security confusion.

**Impact:**
- 7-day tokens are too long for access tokens (security risk)
- 15-minute default may cause UX issues if `.env` isn't properly configured
- Confusion between access token and refresh token lifetimes

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// auth.ts line 22
expiresIn: process.env.JWT_EXPIRES_IN || '15m',
```
```env
# .env.example line 10
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
```

**Recommendation:** Set access token to 15-30 minutes max, document refresh token flow clearly.

---

### 4. Missing Password Reset Implementation
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/auth.ts`
**Issue:** Auth routes include validation schemas for `forgotPasswordSchema` and `resetPasswordSchema` (line 14-15) but no actual endpoints implement password reset functionality.

**Impact:**
- Users cannot recover accounts with forgotten passwords
- Dead code and unused email templates
- Critical user account feature missing

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// auth.ts imports validation schemas
import {
  forgotPasswordSchema,
  resetPasswordSchema,
  // ... imported but never used
}
```

**Recommendation:** Implement POST `/api/auth/forgot-password` and POST `/api/auth/reset-password` endpoints.

---

### 5. Missing Email Verification Flow
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/auth.ts`, `services/api/src/services/emailService.ts`
**Issue:** Email service has verification templates and auth has `verifyEmailSchema`, but no endpoint exists to verify emails. Users are created with `isVerified: false` but can never become verified.

**Impact:**
- `requireVerified` middleware (auth.ts:95) will block all new users permanently
- Sellers cannot list on marketplace (requires verification)
- Email verification URLs sent to users will 404

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// auth.ts line 21 - imported but no endpoint
verifyEmailSchema,
```

**Recommendation:** Implement POST `/api/auth/verify-email` endpoint to handle verification tokens.

---

## High Severity Defects

### 6. No Transaction Support for Critical Operations
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/parts.ts:558-567`
**Issue:** When marking a part as SOLD, two database operations occur (update part status + increment seller sales) without transaction wrapping. If the second operation fails, data becomes inconsistent.

**Impact:**
- Seller's `totalSales` count may be inaccurate
- Race conditions in concurrent updates
- Data integrity issues

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// parts.ts line 550-567
const updatedPart = await prisma.part.update({ ... });

// No transaction - if this fails, part is updated but sales aren't
if (validatedData.status === 'SOLD' && existingPart.status !== 'SOLD') {
  await prisma.seller.update({ ... });
}
```

**Recommendation:** Wrap related operations in `prisma.$transaction()`.

---

### 7. SQL Injection Risk in Search Queries
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/search.ts:45-65`
**Issue:** While Prisma provides some protection, the complex `OR` queries with `contains` and `mode: 'insensitive'` can cause performance issues and potential injection if special characters aren't properly escaped.

**Impact:**
- Performance degradation on large datasets
- Potential for query manipulation
- Database overload with crafted queries

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// search.ts line 45
if (filters.query) {
  whereClause.OR = [
    { name: { contains: filters.query, mode: 'insensitive' } },
    { description: { contains: filters.query, mode: 'insensitive' } },
    { partNumber: { contains: filters.query, mode: 'insensitive' } }
  ];
}
```

**Recommendation:** Add input sanitization, implement full-text search with PostgreSQL, add query length limits.

---

### 8. Missing Input Validation on Bulk Operations
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/parts.ts:634-707`
**Issue:** Bulk update endpoints validate array length but don't validate individual part IDs format or impose maximum array size limits.

**Impact:**
- DoS attack vector (send 100,000 IDs)
- Invalid UUIDs could cause database errors
- Resource exhaustion

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// parts.ts line 640
if (!Array.isArray(partIds) || partIds.length === 0) {
  // Checks for empty, but no upper limit
```

**Recommendation:** Add max array size (e.g., 100), validate ID format with Zod schema.

---

### 9. Insufficient Rate Limiting Granularity
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts:21`
**Issue:** Rate limiter only checks if path starts with `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/register`, missing other sensitive endpoints like password reset, email verification, and admin routes.

**Impact:**
- Admin endpoints unprotected from brute force
- Upload endpoints vulnerable to spam
- Search API can be abused for scraping

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// rateLimiter.ts line 21
if (req.path.startsWith('/api/auth/login') || req.path.startsWith('/api/auth/register')) {
  await authLimiter.consume(req.ip || 'unknown');
}
```

**Recommendation:** Add dedicated rate limiters for admin (stricter), uploads (file-based), and search (moderate).

---

### 10. No HTTPS Enforcement Mechanism
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/index.ts`
**Issue:** No middleware to enforce HTTPS in production. While Helmet is used (line 31), it doesn't redirect HTTP to HTTPS or set HSTS headers by default.

**Impact:**
- Credentials transmitted over plain HTTP
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Session hijacking

**Recommendation:** Add HTTPS redirect middleware and configure Helmet with HSTS in production.

---

### 11. Email Service Failing Silently
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/services/emailService.ts:86-88`
**Issue:** When email service is not configured, it returns `false` and logs a message, but calling code in auth routes doesn't check return value. Users think emails were sent but they weren't.

**Impact:**
- Users never receive verification emails
- Password reset emails not sent
- No error feedback to users or admins

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// emailService.ts line 86-88
if (!this.isConfigured || !this.transporter) {
  console.log('Email service not configured - email not sent');
  return false;
}
```

**Recommendation:** Throw error if email is required, or add warning to API response.

---

### 12. Missing Database Connection Pool Configuration
**Severity:** HIGH
**Location:** `services/api/src/utils/database.ts`
**Issue:** Prisma client is used directly without explicit connection pool configuration. Default settings may not be optimal for production load.

**Impact:**
- Connection exhaustion under load
- Poor performance during traffic spikes
- Database connection leaks

**Recommendation:** Configure Prisma connection pool size and timeout in schema or environment variables.

---

## Medium Severity Defects

### 13. Inconsistent Error Response Format
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Multiple routes
**Issue:** Some error responses return `ApiResponse<null>` with `error` and `message` fields, while rate limiter returns plain object without `success: false` field.

**Impact:**
- Frontend must handle multiple error formats
- API documentation becomes complex
- Developer confusion

**Recommendation:** Standardize all error responses to use `ApiResponse<T>` wrapper.

---

### 14. Missing API Versioning
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `services/api/src/index.ts:72-84`
**Issue:** All routes are mounted at `/api/*` without version prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/`). Future breaking changes will be difficult to deploy.

**Impact:**
- Breaking changes affect all clients immediately
- No graceful migration path
- Mobile apps may break on server updates

**Recommendation:** Add `/api/v1/` prefix to all routes, prepare versioning strategy.

---

### 15. No Request ID Tracking
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `services/api/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts:11-17`
**Issue:** Error logging includes timestamp, URL, method, but no unique request ID. Difficult to trace requests across distributed logs.

**Impact:**
- Debugging production issues is harder
- Cannot correlate frontend errors with backend logs
- Performance monitoring incomplete

**Recommendation:** Add middleware to generate and inject request IDs into all logs and responses.

---

### 16. Hardcoded Pagination Limits
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Multiple route files (e.g., `vehicles.ts:33`, `parts.ts:39`)
**Issue:** Maximum page size is hardcoded to 100 in each route. No centralized configuration.

**Impact:**
- Inconsistency if different routes use different limits
- Hard to adjust for performance tuning
- Code duplication

**Recommendation:** Move to shared constant in config file.

---

### 17. Missing Health Check for External Services
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `services/api/src/index.ts:52-69`
**Issue:** Health check only verifies database connection, doesn't check Redis, email service, or Cloudinary.

**Impact:**
- Kubernetes/load balancers may route to unhealthy instances
- Degraded service goes undetected
- Monitoring incomplete

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive health checks for all critical dependencies.

---

### 18. No Logging Correlation for User Actions
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Throughout route handlers
**Issue:** Logs don't include user ID or session information for authenticated requests. Security auditing is difficult.

**Impact:**
- Cannot trace malicious user actions
- GDPR data requests harder to fulfill
- Security incident response hampered

**Recommendation:** Add user context to logger in authentication middleware.

---

### 19. Prisma Schema Missing Some Useful Indexes
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
**Issue:** While many indexes exist, some common query patterns are not indexed:
- `Part` missing composite index on `(vehicleId, status)`
- `Seller` missing index on `(businessType, isVerified)`

**Impact:**
- Slower queries as dataset grows
- Poor performance for seller dashboards
- Increased database load

**Recommendation:** Add composite indexes based on common WHERE clause combinations.

---

### 20. Missing Image Validation on Upload
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/uploads.ts`
**Issue:** File not found in the read context, but based on patterns, likely missing MIME type validation, image dimensions check, and malware scanning.

**Impact:**
- Users could upload malicious files
- Large images cause performance issues
- Storage costs from unoptimized uploads

**Recommendation:** Implement image validation middleware with Sharp for dimension checks.

---

## Low Severity Issues

### 21. Missing OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:** No auto-generated API documentation for frontend developers.

**Recommendation:** Add Swagger/OpenAPI spec generation.

---

### 22. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:** Some files use `camelCase`, others use `PascalCase` for class exports.

**Recommendation:** Standardize on single convention in style guide.

---

### 23. Missing Unit Tests
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** `services/api/src/__tests__/`
**Issue:** Only one integration test file found (`parts.test.ts`). No unit tests for utilities, middleware, or services.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive test coverage with target >80%.

---

### 24. Environment Variables Not Typed
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:** `process.env.JWT_SECRET` accessed directly without type safety or validation on startup.

**Recommendation:** Create env validator using Zod at application startup.

---

### 25. Missing Soft Delete Pattern
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
**Issue:** All models use hard deletes. No `deletedAt` timestamp for data recovery.

**Recommendation:** Add soft delete pattern for critical entities like Parts, Vehicles, Sellers.

---
